# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Versions below a stable 1.0.0 mean the project is still in development.

You may still report vulnerabilities as long as the project has not reached a stable 1.0.0 milestone.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may only report vulnerabilities in the code of this repository. Please report vulnerabilities in upstream libraries to the appropriate owner.

If you find vulnerabilities you may send a mail to security@bean.tools or via Discord DM.

Please keep in mind that this is a small, unfunded project and as such we sadly cannot offer you compensation.
